Firehose is a cloud native service for delivering real-time streaming data to destinations such as service endpoints (HTTP or GRPC) & managed databases (Postgres, InfluxDB,  Redis, Elasticsearch, Prometheus and MongoDB). With Firehose, you don't need to write applications or manage resources. It can be scaled up to match the throughput of your data. If your data is present in Kafka, Firehose delivers it to the destination(SINK) that you specified.

## Key Features
Discover why users choose Firehose as their main Kafka Consumer

* **Sinks:** Firehose supports sinking stream data to log console, MongoDB, Prometheus, HTTP, GRPC, PostgresDB(JDBC), InfluxDB, Elasticsearch & Redis.
* **Scale:** Firehose scales in an instant, both vertically and horizontally  for high performance streaming sink and zero data drops.
* **Extensibility:** Add your own sink to firehose with a clearly defined interface or choose from already provided ones.
* **Runtime:** Firehose can run inside VMs or containers in a fully managed runtime environment like kubernetes.
* **Metrics:** Always know what’s going on with your deployment with built-in [monitoring](./docs/assets/firehose-grafana-dashboard.json) of throughput, response times, errors and more.

To know more, follow the detailed [documentation](docs)

## Run with Docker
Use the docker hub to download firehose [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/odpf/firehose/). You need to have docker installed in your system.
```
# Download docker image from docker hub
$ docker pull odpf/firehose

# Run the following docker command for a simple log sink.
$ docker run -e SOURCE_KAFKA_BROKERS=127.0.0.1:6667 -e SOURCE_KAFKA_CONSUMER_GROUP_ID=kafka-consumer-group-id -e SOURCE_KAFKA_TOPIC=sample-topic -e SINK_TYPE=log -e SOURCE_KAFKA_CONSUMER_CONFIG_AUTO_OFFSET_RESET=latest -e INPUT_SCHEMA_PROTO_CLASS=com.github.firehose.sampleLogProto.SampleLogMessage -e SCHEMA_REGISTRY_STENCIL_ENABLE=true -e SCHEMA_REGISTRY_STENCIL_URLS=http://localhost:9000/artifactory/proto-descriptors/latest odpf/firehose:latest
```
**Note:** Make sure your protos (.jar file) are located in `work-dir`, this is required for Filter functionality to work.

## Run with Kubernetes
* Create a firehose deployment using the helm chart available [here](https://github.com/odpf/charts/tree/main/stable/firehose)
* Deployment also includes telegraf container which pushes stats metrics
