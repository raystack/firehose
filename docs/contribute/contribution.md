# CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES

## BECOME A COMMITOR & CONTRIBUTE

We are always interested in adding new contributors. What we look for is a series of contributions, good taste, and an ongoing interest in the project.

* Committers will have write access to the Firehose repositories.
* There is no strict protocol for becoming a committer or PMC member. Candidates for new committers are typically people that are active contributors and community members.
* Candidates for new committers can also be suggested by current committers or PMC members.
* If you would like to become a committer, you should start contributing to Firehose in any of the ways mentioned. You might also want to talk to other committers and ask for their advice and guidance.

## WHAT CAN YOU DO?

* You can report a bug or suggest a feature enhancement or can just ask questions. Reach out on Github discussions for this purpose.
* You can modify the code
  * Add any new feature
  * Add a new Sink
  * Improve Health and Monitoring Metrics
  * Improve Logging
* You can help with documenting new features or improve existing documentation.
* You can also review and accept other contributions if you are a Commitor.

## GUIDELINES

Please follow these practices for you change to get merged fast and smoothly:

* Contributions can only be accepted if they contain appropriate testing \(Unit and Integration Tests\).
* If you are introducing a completely new feature or making any major changes in an existing one, we recommend to start with an RFC and get consensus on the basic design first.
* Make sure your local build is running with all the tests and checkstyle passing.
* If your change is related to user-facing protocols / configurations, you need to make the corresponding change in the documentation as well.
* Docs live in the code repo under `docs` so that changes to that can be done in the same PR as changes to the code.
