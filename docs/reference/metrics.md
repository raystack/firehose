# Metrics

Service-level Indicators \(SLIs\) are the measurements used to calculate the performance for the goal. It is a direct measurement of a service’s behaviour and helps us and the users to evaluate whether our system has been running within SLO. The metrics captured as part of SLI for Firehose are described below.

## Type Details

Collection of all the generic configurations in a Firehose.

### `Sink`

* The type of sink of the Firehose. It could be 'log', 'HTTP', 'DB', 'redis', 'influx' or 'Elasticsearch'

### `Team`

* Team who has the ownership for the given Firehose.

### `Proto Schema`

* The proto class used for creating the Firehose

### `Stream`

* The stream where the input topic is read from

## Overview

Some of the most important metrics related to Firehose that gives you an overview of the current state of it.

### `ConsumerLag: MaxLag`

* The maximum lag in terms of number of records for any partition in this window. An increasing value over time is your best indication that the consumer group is not keeping up with the producers.

### `Total Message Received`

* Sum of all messages received from Kafka per pod.

### `Message Sent Successfully`

* Messages sent successfully to the sink per batch per pod.

### `Message Sent Failed`

* Messages failed to be pushed into the sink per batch per pod. In case of HTTP sink, if status code is not in retry codes configured, the records will be dropped.

### `Message Dropped`

* In case of HTTP sink, when status code is not in retry codes configured, the records are dropped. This metric captures the dropped messages count.

### `Batch size Distribution`

* 99p of batch size distribution for pulled and pushed messages per pod. 

### `Time spent in Firehose`

* Latency introduced by Firehose \(time before sending to sink - time when reading from Kafka\). Note: It could be high if the response time of the sink is higher as subsequent batches could be delayed. 

### `Time spent in pipeline`

* Time difference between Kafka ingestion and sending to sink \(Time before sending to sink - Time of Kafka ingestion\) 

### `Sink Response Time`

* Different percentile of the response time of the sink. 

## Pods Health

Since Firehose runs on Kube, this gives a nice health details of each pods.

### `JVM Lifetime`

* JVM Uptime of each pod. 

### `Cpu Load`

* Returns the "recent cpu usage" for the Java Virtual Machine process. This value is a double in the \[0.0,1.0\] interval. A value of 0.0 means that none of the CPUs were running threads from the JVM process during the recent period of time observed, while a value of 1.0 means that all CPUs were actively running threads from the JVM 100% of the time during the recent period being observed. Threads from the JVM include the application threads as well as the JVM internal threads. All values betweens 0.0 and 1.0 are possible depending of the activities going on in the JVM process and the whole system. If the Java Virtual Machine recent CPU usage is not available, the method returns a negative value. 

### `Cpu Time`

* Returns the CPU time used by the process on which the Java virtual machine is running. The returned value is of nanoseconds precision but not necessarily nanoseconds accuracy. 

## Kafka Consumer Details

Listing some of the Kafka consumer metrics here.

### `Assigned partitions`

### `Consumer Number of Request/second`

* Global Request Metrics: The average number of requests sent per second per pod.

### `Average Fetch Size`

* Fetch Metrics: The average number of bytes fetched per request per pod.

### `Max Fetch Size`

* Fetch Metrics: The max number of bytes fetched per request per pod.

### `Commit Rate/second`

### `Connections Close Rate/second`

* Global Connection Metrics: Connections closed per second in the window per pod. 

### `Consumer Outgoing Byte Rate/Sec`

* Global Request Metrics: The average number of outgoing bytes sent per second to all servers per pod. 

### `Avg time between poll`

* Average time spent between poll per pod. 

### `Max time between poll`

* Max time spent between poll per pod. 

### `Sync rate`

* Consumer Group Metrics: The number of group syncs per second per pod. Group synchronization is the second and last phase of the rebalance protocol. Similar to join-rate, a large value indicates group instability. 

### `Consumer Network IO rate /second`

* The average number of network operations \(reads or writes\) on all connections per second per pod 

### `Rebalance Rate /hour`

* Rate of rebalance the consumer.  

### `Average Commit latency`

* Consumer Group Metrics: The average time taken for a commit request per pod 

### `Max Commit latency`

* Consumer Group Metrics: The max time taken for a commit request per pod. 

### `Avg Rebalance latency`

* Average Rebalance Latency for the consumer per pod. 

### `Max Rebalance latency`

* Max Rebalance Latency for the consumer per pod.

## Error

This gives you a nice insight about the critical and noncritical exceptions happened in the Firehose.

### `Fatal Error`

* Count of all the exception raised by the pods which can restart the Firehose.

### `Nonfatal Error`

* Count of all the exception raised by the Firehose which will not restart the Firehose and Firehose will keep retrying.
