# Introduction

Firehose is a cloud-native service for delivering real-time streaming data to destinations such as service endpoints \(HTTP or GRPC\) & managed databases \(MongoDB, Prometheus, Postgres, InfluxDB, Redis, & ElasticSearch\). With Firehose, you don't need to write applications or manage resources. It automatically scales to match the throughput of your data and requires no ongoing administration. If your data is present in Kafka, Firehose delivers it to the destination\(SINK\) that you specified.

## Key Features

Discover why users choose Firehose as their main Kafka Consumer

- **Sinks** Firehose supports sinking stream data to log console, HTTP, GRPC, PostgresDB\(JDBC\), InfluxDB, Elastic Search, Redis, Prometheus and MongoDB.
- **Scale** Firehose scales in an instant, both vertically and horizontally, for high-performance streaming sink and zero data drops.
- **Extensibility** Add your own sink to Firehose with a clearly defined interface or choose from already provided ones.
- **Runtime** Firehose can run inside containers or VMs in a fully managed runtime environment like Kubernetes.
- **Metrics** Always know what’s going on with your deployment with built-in monitoring of throughput, response times, errors, and more.
